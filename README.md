Features still to add:
<!-- -"How many anodes will you be testing?" with a number dropdown to select how many anode test inputs show up on screeen for quicker use, rather than adding an anode one by one (maybe make it an alert?)--> The only problem would be that in the app is coded to refresh after submitting new test results to the DB, so it would popup again when not being needed. 
-An option to import to a trest traveler to print out
-A search feature?
-Blur the background image to hide the fact that the image repeats as you scroll down on the testing pages
<!-- -download the background images to reduce loadtime -->


Known Bugs:
<!-- -Selected number of anodes doesn't work properly. Only the first two test rows to the database. -->
